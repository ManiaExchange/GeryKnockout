- If possible, steps to reproduce the bug

[/ko status](https://github.com/ManiaExchange/GeryKnockout/blob/main/docs/cli.md#ko-status) may be used to shed light upon possible irregularities in the internal state.

If you have access, please provide the console output. If there is sensitive information, you may send the output in a DM to Voyager006#8530 on Discord; encrypted if you'd like.

If you can replicate the crash, set `MinimumLogLevel` to `Log::Debug` in `plugin.knockout.php` in order to get more information in the console window. Note that this may have a negative impact on the server performance, so only do this temporarily.
