Please include

- What happened prior to the bug/crash
- A screenshot of `/ko status`, if TMGery didn't crash
- Console output, if accessible
- Steps to reproduce the bug, if possible

If there is sensitive information, you may send the output in a DM to Voyager006#8530 on Discord.

If you can replicate the issue, set `MinimumLogLevel` to `Log::Debug` in `plugin.knockout.php` in order to get more information in the console window. Note that this may have a negative impact on the server performance, so only do this temporarily.
